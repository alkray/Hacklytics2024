# AI-Driven F1 Predictions

## Introduction

Welcome to our AI-Driven F1 Predictions project! We're excited to present a cutting-edge platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing to provide accurate predictions for Formula 1 (F1) races. By combining historical race data dating back to the 1950s up to 2017 with AWS Sagemaker's advanced numeric prediction models, we offer enthusiasts and analysts a powerful tool for gaining insights into future F1 race outcomes.

## Key Features

### 1. AWS Forecasting Integration

- Utilize AWS numeric prediction for advanced machine learning analysis of historical F1 race data.
- Leverage sophisticated algorithms to identify position trends, considering various factors such as driver skill, race dynamics, and strategy.

### 2. User-Friendly Front End

- Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
- Intuitive interface allows users to input race parameters, view predictions, and explore insights derived from AI models.

### 3. Interactive Visualization

- Incorporate interactive data visualization tools to present predictions and insights in a visually engaging manner.
- Explore trends, compare driver performances, and delve into underlying factors influencing race outcomes.

### 4. Dynamic Prediction Adjustments

- Account for nuances of F1 racing, such as the correlation between qualifying positions and race outcomes based on driver skill.
- Adjust predictions based on dynamic constructor and driver performances throughout the race.

### 5. Continuous Improvement

- Commitment to refining prediction models and enhancing platform capabilities based on feedback and new data.
- Automatic model retraining and optimization capabilities ensure predictions evolve with each race, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Historical race data dating back to the 1950s through 2017 was collected and preprocessed.
2. **AWS Numeric Prediction**: Utilize AWS SageMaker to analyze historical race data and train prediction models.
3. **Model Training**: Train prediction models to identify position trends and account for laptimes and constructor bias.
4. **Front End Development**: Develop a user-friendly front end using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for inputting parameters and visualizing predictions.
5. **Integration & Deployment**: Integrate front end and AWS Forecasting models and deploy the platform for public access.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up AWS Forecasting and import historical race data.
3. Install necessary dependencies for the front end components.
4. Run the application locally or deploy it to a cloud platform for public access.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or new ideas, we appreciate any contributions that help improve the platform.
